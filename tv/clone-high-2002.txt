1  Tonight, on a very special Clone High.   Way way back in the 1980s'    Secret government employees    Dug up famous guys and ladies    And made amusing genetic copies    Now the clones are sexy teens, now    They're gonna make it if they try    Loving learning challenge judging    Time to laugh and shiver and Cry    Clone High, Clone High    Gandhi, this year is going to be different.   I'm taller I've got slightly bigger sideburns   I spent all summer on my high fives and my finger snaps.   I finally I have the acceptance I've so craved!   Joan of Arc! On top!   Don't touch me, Gandhi   Too slow!   Welcome back, Joan.   You got breasts.   Jeez Abe, you grew like, a foot.   You grew like, a pair of breasts.   Luckily the extra height doesn't feel that awkward-- Dinger!   I'm up.   I wish I'd seen you more over the summer but,   - I was at camp. - Was it breast camp?   Okay, you get one more.   Well, brand new year, same old faces.   Hiya, Kennedy.   I invaded her Bay of Pigs. If you catch my meaning.   Oh yeah. Steamed vegetables. What'd mama make for you?   Nine fried peanut butter and banana sandwiches,   and a thermos full of tranquillisers, thank you very much.   I have left the building.   Man, one of the Elvis twins really let himself go.   Hasn't anyone here grown at all?   - You were thinkin' it. - I know.   You know Abe, I've been thinking,   I'm gonna date a lot more this year.   Uh-huh, yeah, I wanna date Cleopatra.   She's attractive, smart, athletic, good looking,   she's hot, photogenic,   she takes pride in her appearance   I guess what I'm trying to say is,   I admire her commitment to community service.   You don't think dating an old friend would be better?   You know, maybe someone that   you know, you take for granted   - Nah, I like Cleo. - But Abe, think about it.   - Like an old friend, you know-- - Nope. Cleo. Only Cleo.   Hi Abe.   Are those longer sideburns?   Abe. I think you're bleeding.   Not. Now.   Fine. I'll go wait for you by the gauze.   Cleopatra, comin' at ya!   Do I know you?   Gandhi. We had every class together last year?   I gave you one of my kidneys?   I miss him.   I was your foster brother for ten years   until you convinced our parents I wasn't good enough for your image   and you had me transferred to another home?   - Benji? - Gandhi.   Oh, that's so great for you.   Anyway, Abe, JFK's having a party Friday.   I hope I see you there.   Hey, Cleo.   Why yes, these are longer sideburns.   The first day of school's always awkward, and just to let you know, I can relate.   You see I'm not just your kindly history teacher,   I'm also the first mostly human clone.   Spliced in a little sheep DNA.   Which is fine, with me.   You can't even tell, Mr Sheepman.   Thank you!   Before you leave, we have an announcement from Miss Of Arc.   I admire her commitment to community service.   Now, I know I don't have to tell you   how committed I am to community service.   That's why I'm starting a teen crisis hot line,   and I'm looking for volunteers.   Dude, that's a three story drop!   I don't care, I'm goin' for it.   Oh my god, I can see my bone!   Oh young, unsuspecting clones.   Little do they know, I control them!   The greatest minds the world has ever known!   For what, is more powerful, than a high school PRINCIPAL!!   Doctor Scudworth.   Sorry to disturb you, but there's growing concern among   the Secret Board of Shadowy Figures that you may be   completely insane.   BLASPHEMY!   Yeah, well, you do have a robot butler named Mr Butlertron.   Anyone for scones?   Why, creating a mechanical British servant   is no more eccentric than that tie you're wearing.   Coffee, Wesley?   He calls everyone Wesley.   Don't know why.   Yeah, that's fascinating.   But we're paying you to monitor these clones as closely as possible,   so if you want to keep your job, you can either write a report   proving you know what it's like to be a student at Clone High,   I'll do no such thing! Or I'm to kill you.   I'll title it, "What's It's Like To Be A Teenage Clone"   colon, "A Rope Of Sand".   Good title. It draws the reader in   without giving too much away   Wesley.   Lincoln!   I got dibs on that Cleopatra broad, so back off!   She's numbers one and two, on my list,   of 150 women to bang this year!   What cha doing in here, buddy, making a Lincoln log?   What's up, Fitzy baby, party at your place on Friday, right?   Rocking!   Yeah, pysched for the rager, j-JFK. Dawg.   I will see you there.   And by will, I mean won't!   'Cause you're not invited.   I, uh, wasn't sure if I was clear earlier.   So, uh, you're not.   Invited, that is.   To my party!   Forgot to wash my hands!   We've gotta get to that party.   Dude, we're never going to get invited, sitting here,   surrounded by geeks.   They're not geeks, Gandhi.   They're just delightfully eccentric.   Hello, cohorts.   It is I, George Washington Carver.   And I spent my summer bioengineering this anthropomorphic peanut.   Hi ho, guv'ner.   I'd shake your hands, but you know. Peanut arms!   All right, they're geeks, but we have better things to do   than worry about who or what we're seen with.   No, Gandhi's right.   This isn't about who we hang out with.   This is about not having to put your hand   on your own buttock and pretend it's a woman's breast.   All I'm sayin' is, a girl is interested in me,   and I'm not going to ignore it.   Abe, I want you.   You want me to what?   Forget what you were going to say? Happens to me all the time.   Well! I'm off!   What?   Kennedy, I have a proposition for you.   Mark my words, Lincoln, you and your friends are uh,   not coming to that party!   I'll get the beer.   Be there at eight!   SHAZAAM! We're in!   Any ideas on how to get the beer?   Nope.   It's time for the presidential fitness test!   Where we make you even more insecure about your bodies,   by checking you while you perform arbitrary physical tasks!   I can't believe we got Elanor Roosevelt as a gym teacher.   Yeah, he's great.   You know Abe, tonight I finally have a night off from the hotline?   Which is, community service.   So I was thinking we could like, you know,   carpool to JFK's party, you know,   save gas   Like talkin', Of Arc?   Well, you can talk your tight little buns into principal Scudworth's office!   Slowly   Hey, stud.   I'm so glad you're getting the beer tonight.   I just love underage drinking.   I know?   Okay, how the hell am I gonna get that beer?   Easy.   Tell them they heard you wrong.   What you said was "I'll get the beards".   That makes no sense.   Yeah, but if you think about it, it would still be a pretty sweet party.   This is the best party ever, thanks Gandhi!   Okay, Ghengis Khan.   If the clerk asks if you're over twenty-one, say yes, got it?   You over twenty-one?   Okay. He used a very tricky line of questioning.   Let's practice again.   Are you over twenty-one?   Yes.   You over twenty-one?   No.   So I guess you're twenty-one.   I am twenty-one.   I'm not twenty-one!   Miss Of Arc!   I'll overlook your little gym class disruption   if you'll help me with a report I'm writing.   Tell me your likes and dislikes!   Well I dislike being tied to a chair.   Good! I'll use a big font, futz with the margins   and I'll be home in time for Jay Leeno!   You would like Leno.   How dare you insult that big chinned everyman   and his various African-American bandleaders!   Perhaps you'll learn some respect   spending the rest of the afternoon in my DEATH MAZE!   Oh, this is useless.   I need to observe the teenagers in their element.   I will be Diane Fossy, and they the gorillas.   But where, can I find, the mist?   Attention students.   JFK will be having a huge kegger night.   STUDENTS ONLY!   That is all.   You seem to have this compulsion to "nail" Cleo.   Whaddaya think drives this desire to act overly macho?   Well uh, it's my foster parents.   You uh, know that show "My Two Dads"?   It's uh, like that but more gay!   Mm, look how nice he looks in the dockers we bought him.   Daaaad!   What, you're too good to be gay like your old man?!   Carl, it is not his fault.   Baby was born that way.   Death maze, huh?   Oh, I was in the maze once.   It was hot.   You know, I'm hot now.   I think I'll take my shirt off.   Ready for the weekend!   Gandhi, I think it's really big of you   to skip the party and work the hotline tonight.   Uh, of course.   Sure, I buckled under the pressure of living up to the original Gandhi   and became a non stop party machine,   but dammit, I still care.   So Joan?   You can count on me.   Uh no, no, I'm not at a party,   we're just really busy here at the teen hotline!   Susie, Kelly, do me a favour and make out!   So, you're depressed.   Hey everybody, it's me, Abe!   Hey everybody, it's a keg of beer!   Abe!   Hey, I thought you had to work the hotline tonight.   No man, I just forwarded the calls to my cell phone!   Look, I'll talk to you when you can stop crying.   You're not afraid of Joan catching and ultimately killing you?   Oh, uh, I'm scared.   Well I think I'll just jump of this balcony in case she--   Oh my God!   Well congratulations, Abe.   The people were clamouring to make asses of themselves,   and you gave them the means to do it.   Not exactly.   I uh, I could only get non-alcoholic beer.   They're going to be able to tell.   I'm a pony.   You'll be fine.   Joan, do you ever like someone so much you're afraid   you're gonna blurt out something stupid?   I have a rash on my back.   Are you sure this is the best way to do research?   Won't they be able to tell we're not students?   You underestimate me, my metal friend.   Whassup, fellow students?   Raise the roof! Raise it!   Where are my bitches?   Sometimes I just turn the lights off in my room and cry.   I'm sorry uh, Van Gough, could you speak up?   The only way I can   cling to my sanity is that nobody knows how   lonely I truely am.   He's sad.   Hilarious!   Hey. Am I on speakerphone?   Hey, would Gandhi put somebody on speakerphone?   No!   Jesus Gandhi, how could you?   Hey man, Gandhi's anti-violence, not anti-comedy.   Whew. Feels good to help people.   Want to talk about it?   You wouldn't understand.   Maybe you should tell Abe how you really feeeeeeel.   What good would that do?   Maybe he just thinks you don't think   he doesn't want to not ruin the friendship.   You make it sound so simple.   Maybe one of us just needs to make the first move.   Maybe that one of us is yoouu.   Thanks, Mr B.   I love you.   Don't mention it   Wesley.   You know Abe,   maybe it's the beer talking.   I doubt it.   It's just I always saw you as this honest guy,   but now I'm seeing you as a cool guy   who just happens to be honest.   Doesn't that blow your mind?   That's me. Cool, honest Abe.   Oh, Abe. It's like there's a tin can phone   from your brain to my heart.   That no good cheating tramp!   Hey, get off my dinghy!   Not you.   What do you think you are uh, doing?   Look Kennedy, we kissed.   And I don't wanna exaggerate the importance of it,   but we're gonna be together forever.   Come on, she's drunk!   She also kissed the talking peanut!   Right here on me left nut!   So uh, who's it gonna be?   Cleo, I care about you.   And every moment we spend together   makes me want to know you more.   My abs are so firm you can grate cheese on 'em!   It's so hard to choose.   I need some time to be alone!   Nacho?   Oh man, that does suck.   If that were me, I would totally kill myself.   Hello?   Hey Joan, cool stun gun!   Wait, I can explain-- Ow!   I'm forwarding-- Oo!   Egg whites only.   Teen Crisis Hotline, we're here because we care.   Not a pinata! It's me!   Your memorable school chum, Cloney McStudent!   Pinata!   Well, choosing between a jerk who's good for your image   and a nice sensitive guy   is not really much of a problem   What should I do?   Go for the jerk!   Ooh, and sleep with him right away,   it's never too early for your first time.   Oh and also, don't floss your teeth.   You do have to make sacrifices to be the best.   dammit.   You know what?   Go with the nicer guy.   And, flossing keeps gums healthy   and removes plaque from hard to brush areas.   Did you just screw yourself!   You know, even if these pants do fall off, I'm still wearing boxers.   Ah, good thing there was no one around to see that.   Oh yes. No one indeed.   After consulting, a random person on the telephone,   I've come to a decision.   I choose you.   Oh! Dammit. Great.   Abe.   I'm Happy.   Sorry my dear boy, salty seconds!   Wanna beer?   Sure.   Maybe pretending to be drunk will ease the pain.   So uh, are you uh, drunk enough yet to sleep with me?   Bobby!   Answer the question!   Dinger!   Well, well, well. If it isn't my old friend.   Underage drinking.   So we meet again.   How are you, underage drinking?   Besides illegal?   Underage drinking?   Shame on all of you! Shaaame!   Back to you, Kojack.   This kid's not sober, is he?   And none of you are twenty-one, are you?   And these pot stickers aren't made with real crab, are they?   I stand corrected.   You! You're holding a beer, get in. Get in!   Well that's two, which is all we can fit in the squad car.   The rest of you are free to go.   Come on Abe. Leave your friends behind,   and come back to my soundproofed basement.   Let. Them. Go.   Son. If we don't enforce the drinking age,   then the excitement of sneaking aroun   to get wasted might disappear forever.   Do you want that on your shoulders, pal?   It's non alcoholic beer.   I knew it!   I guess I was just looking for what all of us are.   Acceptance.   Loser!   He coughed!   I am so funny.   Where's my report?   Shadowy Figure! It's actually a funny story.   I was working on it, and I tried to email it to myself,   but then my roommate--   That is a funny story. Mr Butlertron.   Lower the shades and lay down a tarp.   Okay! I spent an entire weekend among the teenagers!   I was humiliated, degraded, judged.   I felt so alone.   Where'd he go?   I guess you proved to him you understand   what it feels like to be a teenager and a pinata.   Well from now on, I'll be more sensitive   to the awkwardness  and the emotional insecurity of today's youth!   Out of my way, fatty!   You too, bad skin.   Well, I'm not gonna let this get me down. Dinger!   I'm up!   Look, right now you're a loser, a big one,   but soon someone else will make an even bigger ass of themselves,   and everyone else will forget about what a big big big big loser you are.   Thanks, Van Gough.   I hate this school.   Next week on a very special Clone High:   Abe's competition with JFK heats up at the school election.   Gandhi provides some sort of comic relief.   And special guest star Marilyn Manson   makes a shocking confession.   My name is Marilyn Manson,   and I'll see you next time, at Clone High.
1  Previously, on a very special Clone High.   Tempers flared.   Robotic butlers cared.   Saliva was shared.   And you, the audience, were moved very, very deeply.   Trust me.   Way way back in the 1980s'    Secret government employees    Dug up famous guys and ladies    And made amusing genetic copies    Now the clones are sexy teens, now    They're gonna make it if they try    Loving learning challenge judging    Time to laugh and shiver and Cry    Clone High, Clone High    All students are special at Clone High,   but only some students are ostracised   because they are special.   That is why it is my great pleasure,   as president of the student body,   to officially dedicate this impassable moat   protecting us from the Special Ed classroom.   I'm surprised Cleopatra didn't fill the moat with acid.   Actually, Cleo says it would kill the piranhas.   Joan of Arc, don't think about the moat in terms of its devisive ignorance,   think of it as an opportunity for building community.   Hey, community! Skinny dipping in the piranha moat!   Everybody get naked!   Finally, I won't be running for re-election this year.   This is probably the last time I'll ever use these oversized novelty scissors,   unless   a giant needs a haircut!   Oh god!   I've gotta go console her.   Abe Lincoln, don't!   She's just trying to get attention and you're falling for it!   Ugh, it makes me so mad I could kiss you!   What was that last part?   I'm sorry, what?   No, I I said, I I I cou-- I could piss glue   As in uh, "Oh, I'm so angry I I could piss glue".   - I've never heard of that. - It's a very common expression.   Well, see ya.   Stupid, Joan.   Real stupid.   Oh, JFK.   I can't bear to talk about it.   Thank god, because I hate it when--   It all started freshman year, I was   elected president.   But now   But now Oh, JFK.   There, there.   It's term limits, Jack.   Dirty, dirty term limits   My only hope is that someone, and I have no idea who,   could run, win, abolish term limits,   resign, and endorse me as his replacement.   But who?   Who?   Thank you JFK.   Thank you, For your courage.   Can we make out now?   Totally.   Hey Cleo.   Your secret army of cloned historical figures   is maturing according to schedule.   I'm sorry, Scudworth, is that a scale model behind you   labelled "Dr Scudworth's Evil Plan"?   Saaay.   Where'd you get those fresh Pumas, bro?   Actually, we're sponsored by Puma.   These bad boys are catalogue only.   If you're implying that I intend to steal the clones away from you,   and use them in an expensive clone themed amusement park,   then shame on you!   By the by, could I have two million dollars?   You know,   for dry erase markers and such!   They've got some keen new colours, and kiwi, and   mango   For giggles, I'm going to keep saying no until you turn the TV off.   No no no no no no no no no.   Perhaps you could get Clone High a coperate sponsor.   Those Pumas were rather freeesh.   Sell out?   And turn the school into an ad for some profit-hungry corporation?   Why, that idea's as foolish as getting new brakes from anywhere but Midas.   I can't believe that JFK is running unopposed.   I mean, you'd think with a school full of world leaders,   someone would be into student government.   Well, I'm a genetic dupilcate of Abe Lincoln.   I'm not fit to be president.   If I only knew what fears and insecurities were holding me back.   Abe, you should run.   I mean together, we'll fight for things that really matter,   like new bishops for the chess club!   So what you're saying is,   if I run for president, I can get Cleo to like me.   That's why she likes JFK, because he's a natural leader.   Great idea, Joan.   Clumsy, Joan. Reeaally clumsy.   So your product is called   X-STREAM BLU!   IT'S A POWER SNACK! STICK IT IN YOUR FACE HOLE!   Is it something you eat?   It's really just pancake batter mixed with blue house paint in a blue sports bottle.   SICK! TIGHT! CYBER AWESOME!   I see.   Now, for allowing you to test market this X-Stream Blu on my students,   I am willing to be paid two million dollars.   Allow me to confer with my associates.   TO THE MAX!   I HAVE LOW SELF ESTEEM!   We accept your offer.   Dead presidents, Mr B!   Ask not what your student body president can do for you!   Ask what you can do to your student body president's body!   Abe, there's nothing to worry about.   He's making empty promises and detailing his workout routine.   And on Fridays, I do abs and legs, but not calves!   As you recall, I do those, with my lats, on Wednesdays!   Thank you!   Good luck.   My name is Abraham Lincoln,   and I'm running for student body president!   I love you, JFK!   We've got a lot of, uh, tough issues facing us right now   such as adding a second session of AP Calculus   for those who have a conflicting class with AP Physics!   But, first and foremost,   we must get tinted windows for the albino wing!   Okay, you're done   Young men and women, please give it up,   for the X-Stream Blu, Mega Crew!   Hey everyone, I'm Tyler, that's Paco,   and we want you to get up out of your seats and clap your hands to the beat!   'Cause we're here to tell ya about X-Stream Blu!   A new, wicked food product that lives where X-Stream meets Blu!   It comes in a totally sick wide mouthed squeeze bottle!   EMAIL!   That looks so good! What's in it?   Great question! Have a t-shirt!   That totally answers my question!   Man, the audience was not havin' that.   Huh guys?   Uh, Abe?   Just give me a few more minutes of denial.   Abe, Abe! Your speech wasn't that bad!   O-okay, maybe the encore, not the best idea idea,   but the speech itself--   What stinks in here, man?   Oh yeah, it's your campaign.   You died out there.   I mean, that assembly was like this boom this!   You're the boom.   No matter how hard I try to live up to the real Abe Lincoln,   I always fail!   Hey, don't worry man, your problems are answered.   See, I met these really cool guys after the assembly that will so get you.   Guys, come on in here, man!   X-STREAM BLU IN THE HIZZOUSE!   FLIP A NOLLIE AND TURN IT UP!   LINCOLN AND X-STREAM BLU WILL LITERALLY CRUNCH THE GOOGLY TO THE MAX!   HOT SAUCE!   See, they wanna sponsor your campaign.   And all you gotta do, is abandon your values,   and promote their product by doing some dangerous extreme sports related stunts!   JUST SIGN THIS LEGIT-ASS CONTRACT!   AND TOTALLY INITIAL ARTICLE SEVEN!   MY SON WON'T EVEN LOOK ME IN THE EYE ANYMORE!   W-w-wait. What about the issues, Abe?   What about the carpet in the library?   Ooh, Abe's big choice.   Ooh, I wonder what it will be? I'm so worried.   I'll never make it.   Maybe I can help, slice dawg!   Blushi!   But I'm not match for that gang of snow sharks!   Don't worry, bro! Blushi gonna stream it hardcore!   No way!   Hop on, it's pram sports you!   Let's go surf the internet!   But what should we do with all this X-Stream Blu?   Spray it in your face and slam it!   Abe Lincoln, for student body president.   Do you think it's too much?   Abe, I just polled everyone in the girl's bathroom.   You're ahead!   I knew the polls-- did you say I was winning?!   Straight up, man. Numbers don't lie.   I'm the number five!   Cleo! Why are you crying?   I just don't think   things are going to work out with JFK.   I am so sorry.   I need someone to comfort me.   Someone who's leading the polls.   And who's named Abe.   Wait. You're named Abe.   Aren't you, Abe?   To the max, Cleo.   To the max.   That's it!   All the pictures of him I have over my bed are coming down!   Except for that one where's he's under the tree with his shirt off.   We're rich, Mr B!   Bling bling.   But shouldn't you be saving some of this money for your secret plan   instead of having me gold plated and lowered?   Don't get all up in my business, my hydraulically outfitted friend.   Why, I watched the first two thirds of the Mc Hammer Behind The Music,   and if there's one thing I've learned about money,   it's that it never runs out!   Hey uh,   gay foster dads?   How do I get everyone to like me?   Baby, a lot of people liked the original JFK because he was such a caring leader,   and he inspired a generation of young people!   I thought he was a macho, womanising stud,   who conquered the MOON!   Hark!   That sounds like the gentle knock of a vulnerable teenage girl!   You're wet.   Allow me to dry you off   with my pants!   I wanna manage your campaign.   Hey, whatever you're into.   Dads!   I'm gonna be uh, busy nailing this kinky broad for the next fifteen minutes!   Would you shut up?   I'm here because I can't stand Abe being Cleo's puppet.   And you can't win the election without my help.   Here's what we're gonna do.   And then   Well how about   Dental dam!   Bobby!   Okay, no dental dam.   Folks, for my next totally outrageous campaign stunt,   I will ride this board,   which is connected by a bungee cord,   to this monster truck,   which my friend Gandhi will drive back and forth on this half pipe.   Just like the real Abe Lincoln would've done,   had he the tools to do so.   Hey everybody!   Something is uh, on the er, closed circuit TV!   Abraham Lincoln.   Honest Abe. Or so he'd have you believe.   Last year, Abe said he was fifteen years old.   Now he claims to be sixteen.   Which is it, Abe?   Better keep your story straight.   He'd also like you to believe that he's not a baby eater.   He's never gone on record saying he isn't.   Maybe he's too busy eating babies.   I can't wait to eat this--   Baby?   When's it gonna stop, Abe?   Not voting for Abe.   It just makes sense.   Where did JFK get my spaghetti video?   JFK would like to thank Joan of Arc for her help on this ad!   Hey, turn that frown upside down, Abe.   At least it can't any worse.   How many times have I told you not to say that?   Now something worse is gonna happen.   I've seen it on Happy Days, watch. In three. Two. One.   Abe.   Abe. I'm really confused about my feelings right now.   I think I just   need some time to be alone.   With JFK.   Wait.   At least it can't get any better!   It doesn't work that way, Gandhi.   The heart in my mind has been hoping    And the mind and my heart has been wishing    Abe?   What are you doing here?   I come out here to think sometimes.   Me too.   Well right now all I can think about is   not thinking about you over there on your thinking dock,   thinking about what you did.   I was only trying to help, Abe.   You don't know what you're getting into.   What she's getting you into.   You don't know what you're getting into!   And that's out of, my friendship.   And you know what hurts the most, Joan?   This nail I just stepped on.   But there's a metaphorical nail in my other foot that hurts the second most,   and it's from you backstabbing me.   So maybe instead of the nail metaphor,   I should've used a stabbing metaphor,   but it's too late for that now, isn't it?   I guess it is.   That's where you're wrong, Joan!   Because I'm going to win that election with the most dangerous campaign stunt   since Dukakis jumped the Snake River Canyon.   Goodbye, Joan.   Goodbye, Joan.   Hello, Clone High!   X-Stream Blu presents,   the X-Stream Blu high school presidential debate!   With celebrity panelists Marilyn Manson,   Mena Suvari, and introducing Murray T. Wayans!   And now. He risks his ass   to thrill his class, Aaaaaaaabe Lincooooln!   And on this podium,   captain, of the football team,   and el capitan of the fÃÂºtbol team,   J! F! K!   I can't see, due to the glare,   from Mena Suvari's enormous forehead!   The next question is for JFK.   How do you respond to the criticism that,   unlike Abe and myself,   you won't put yourself at risk of physical harm in order to gain approval.   That is a uh, good question, scary androgynous white guy!   And I would like to reply by uh,  taking my shirt off!   My bare chested opponent raises a good point.   But he's avoiding the fact that X-Stream Blu   is mad packed with all nine essential nutrimites to fortify your X-zone!   - May I respond to that? - Yes you may.   Abe's a tot muncher!   Oh yeah?   For my rebuttal, I'd like to dramatically gesture   to this giant death defying skateboard ramp behind me.   I intend to ride said ramp. Gandhi?   You may now attach the skateboard   To my head!   Abe, it all comes down to   thiiiiiis.   Gaaaaaaaaaaaandhiiiiiii!   - Marilyn Manson? - Yes.   It is my professional opinion, as a singer and a licensed doctor,   that this student is suffering from malnutrition.   Mena?   I'm going to need one milligram of sub-cue glucagon, stat!   How can this be?   What have I done?   Fellow students,   X-Stream Blu is a sham.   For four days straight, Gandhi ate nothing but   pancake batter and blue house paint.   A shallow ploy, by Racist Mammy Breakfast Foods,   to jazz up an old product with extreme marketing.   The same marketing scheme I used to win your votes.   Well, I don't deserve your votes!   I suck!   There goes our ghetto fabulous lifestyle.   Bling, bling.   Wait, everyone.   You should vote for Abe.   Because a real leader does what Abe just did,   and what he always does.   He stands up for the right thing,   even if it makes him look like a jackass.   That's the kind of jackass I want in my corner.   That's the highest score yet on the Applause-O-Meter,   the official voting system of Clone Hiiigh.   Looks like Lincoln is your new president.   You're gonna make a great-ass president.   Thanks, Joan.   For showing me how to be a real-ass leader.   Hey, check out that stray puppy!   Oh my god, he is so cute!   And he's licking that dead Smurf's face!   Fine, whatever!   This random dog is your new president!   Hey there, president. That's a cute collar.   Well, we sure learned a lot today.   I'll say.   But there's just one thing I don't understand, Doctor Manson.   How does a growing boy like me eat a healthy, balanced diet?   Well Gandhi, I'll tell you.   The only way I know how.   The ancient pharaohs were not too bright they say    But they made on contribution    that I live by to this day    It's the food pyramid    and it's approved by the USDA    Oh grains are the foundation    So please take my advice    Have five to eleven servings of bread, cereal or rice    Three to five of vegetables and four of fruits is best    Their antioxidants and fibre help you to digest    Three servings of yoghurt, milk and cheese    Will help your bones and subsidise the cattle industries    A body needs to grow    And growing takes proteins    That's why meat can be a tasty treat    like fish or human beings    When you eat your sweets    Make sure you try    To limit your serving    Or you'll DIIIEEE!!    Everybody!   My body is a pyramid that's made of healthy food.   So do what we say!   Eat right every day!   Food! IIIII looooove yooooou!   Buy American.   Well I guess we did learn that.   Next time, on a very special Clone High.   Someone open mouthed kisses someone else.   So set your VCRs for stunned.   Because you will be.   Oh, you will be.
1  Previously, on a very special Clone High.   Some voted with their heads.   Some voted with their hearts.   Cleopatra voted with her student body.   And you the audience, voted to absolutely riveted.   Way way back in the 1980s'    Secret government employees    Dug up famous guys and ladies    And made amusing genetic copies    Now the clones are sexy teens, now    They're gonna make it if they try    Loving learning challenge judging    Time to laugh and shiver and Cry    Clone High, Clone High    Check it out.   I'm the guy with two french fries up his nose! Get it?   That's hilarious, Gandhi!   - Aw, your impressions are awesome. - Uh, spaz?   Putting fries up your nose is not an impression.   You actually are a guy with fries up his nose!   Oh, you like impressions, huh?   Hi, I'm Joan of Arc, and I wear a retainer.   Hi, I'm Abe Lincoln, and I've never laughed   laughed so hard in my life.   Up high, h-onest Habe!   This bent wire better not cause an overbite, or in three to five years, I'm gonna--   Perfect!   Sorry. I didn't see you there.   I did, but I didn't say anything.   Wow Cleo, you're doing a bang-up job promoting the Awareness Fair.   This year, the theme for the awareness fair is   awareness.   - That is a good theme! - I like it also!   And for a fundraiser,   I'm hosting an open mouth kissing booth.   For herpes awareness?   Gandhi'll take a little sugar right now.   Show some respect!   JFK'll take a little sugar right now!   That was so hot.   The girls definitely won't walk away from our kissing booth disappointed.   Our uh opened mouth kissing booth?   More like your uh opened mouth kissing booth!   You know my policy regarding fatties.   But you don't see me complaining about having to kiss poor people!   I'm sure you can make an exception for one day.   Well I'm tired of making exceptions, hussy!   And I'm tired of playing second fiddle to that pooch!   There's nothing going on between me and President Dog!   What happened to us, Cleo?   I'll bet you let him poop in your backyard too!   Ring a ding ding, Mr Butlertron.   - Hell of a show last night, Mr B. - High five, sir.   Mr B! I'm the principal,   and you're a mere butler slash vice principal slash dehumidifier,   yet every student says hello to you and ignores me!   How can I get close to the students?   - I try to listen with compassion, instead of killing them. - Of course!   It's that soothing cardigan sweater of yours!   Cleo, uh, what're you doing here?   I come here whenever I break up with JFK.   - Seems like I've been here a lot lately. - Then these are lucky roses.   How do you mean?   'cause you visit them?   Actually, Abe, flowers are just the reproductive organs of plants.   - They can't tell when someone visit them. - But   I'm just feeling sad.   I don't know how I'll manage the opened mouth kissing booth.   Well I can help. I love opened mouth kissing.   It's so much more open than closed mouth kissing.   Don't feel alone.   - God is always with you. - Did you say something?   The voices!   Finally! The voices!   Come on now! Talk to me!   I am uh, not gonna open up to you!   Lynn, quick, your cardigan!   But it's cold and flu season.   Give it!   Behold, the soothing power of this enchanted sweater vest.   Behold it!   Do you have a BB gun?   I have several.   Wanna go shoot birds sometime?   I would love to!   B, D, B, C, C, A, D,   - Woop, I'm done! - Do you mind?   We're taking a test!   Gandhi! Just try and sit still until everyone is finished.   Not a problem, Mr Sheepman.   Rhythm is everywhere!   It's true, it's everywhere!   Darn it, Gandhi, I've had with your constant fidgeting!   Who did that?   Your innocent whistling doesn't fool me.   I'm seventy percent sure that farting noise came from you.   Hall monitor!   I am so on today!   Quit fidgeting, boy!   Can't you see I'm wearing a cardigan?   What's his deal, man?   Impulsiveness, hyperactivity, short attention span.   I'll run the symptoms through my computer.   Oh Wesley. You have ADD.   ADD?   Am I   dying?   No, it's ADD, Attention Deficit Disorder.   You also have ADHD, its hyperactive cousin.   Wow, I   I need a minute to think about this.   Hey, check out this extra flabby skin on my elbow!   What is that?   Did you hear, Did you hear?    - Gandhi has ADD - Incurable disease    Did you hear, did you hear?    Don't tell Paul Revere    - Gandhi is contagious - Totally outrageous    - A disease with initials? - That's the worst kind    ADD has warped his mind    Did you hear, Did you hear?    Don't tell Paul Revere    Don't tell Paul Reveeeereeee    Too laaaaaate!    Gandhi has ADD, Gandhi has ADD    You get it from toilet seats. Use a protective sheet    Attention Deficit Disordeeeer    ADD!    It can't be true.   But then again, it is rhythmed.   So it must be.   JesÃÂºs Cristo,   do you know the story of Joan of Arc?   Yeah, I seen the movie out on DVD, homes.   She was like sixteen, right?   And then God told her to make the Frenchies fight the Englisses, you know,   the people that drink tea all the time and have big teeth?   And then, people started getting mad 'cause she was hearing voices,   and then at the end, she got cooked like a steak.   Pretty good, I give it thumbs up, homes.   Basically.   See, I've never been able to live up to her, that's why instead,   I became a cynical, angst-ridden goth girl.   But now, I'm hearing voices.   Religious voices.   Daaaamn.   Hey, did he tell you who's gonna win the Latin Grammys?   If it's Ricky Martin, don't tell me hey, don't tell me.   It's Ricky Martin, huh?   It's totally freaking me out!   Hey, take a hit, relax.   God's messages can be a total drag.   But you know you have to do what he tells you hey,   because God has a plan for all of us.   A painful, painful plan.   Wait.   Wait, the voices are telling me to head on down to   Saint Paul's   Mattress Discounters! I have to go!   JesÃÂºs? God's power is in the mix!   Be careful with that nail gun, JesÃÂºs.   - I'm worried about Gandhi. - Me too.   You don't think he'll freak out and bite me, do you?   He hasn't done anything to hurt anyone!   Hey, which opened mouth kissing technique do you like better?   This one?   Or this one?   Hey uh, Principal, look!   I fit the entire freshman class into just ten lockers!   - Oh man! - Oh my!   Oh JFK, you're such a wonderful boy!   So full of fun and life!   I'm gonna go chuck a dead gopher into the girl's bathroom!   Classic!   Jesus saves, and so will we,   on California kings all weekend long!   If you can find a lower price, God will give you a bed for free!   Oh, feel it! Firm!   But not too firm, just like the Lord!   No, Gene Kelly.   Shuffle, cha-cha, spin left, shimmy,   booty quake, thrust, booty quake, thrust.   Marie Curie's mutated DNA may have left her grotesquely deformed,   but she's a realy glood dancer.   Sorry, I'm late, but somebody forgot to tell El Gandhisimo we had practice.   Hey, before we kick it, can I get someone to stretch my hammies?   Gandhi?   This is really hard to say.   I think maybe 'cause of your condition,   - you shouldn't be-- - You're kicking me off the dance squad.   The Solid Gandhi Dancers?   But I'm the treasurer!   What if you have ADD attack, and you can't pay attention to the moves?   That's not gonna happen. Check this out.   Gandhi stop, you're out of control!   Are you watchin'? Are you watchin'?   'Cause watch this, here it comes, finish.   I don't want that diseased freak going near my Attila!   I don't really think it's safe for Gandhi to wander round without a spacesuit.   Folks, you all know me.   I'm Toots, Joan of Arc's foster grandpa.   Now, I may be blind,   but I can see certain things loud and clear.   This is a room full of scared people   making decisions based on fear, and ignorance.   Now when I left the house this evening,   I intended to go to Giovanni's Italian Restaurant.   I can tell I'm in the wrooong place.   So if you'll excuse me, I'll leave and let you get on with your meeting.   Settle, the bevested principal has the answer!   THERAPUTIC ISOLATION!   - That will solve everything. - I feel so pacified.   - Is that cashmere? - The man in the dapper cardigan is right.   Let's lock him up like a diabetic!   I vote we form an angry mob, just a whole bunch of mens just running.   I've never sat here in the popular section before.   Wow, salt and pepper?   With me, Abe?   It's first class all the way.   Abe, you've gotta help me!   You're all I have, man! Is that pepper?   Abe, do you have a celibacy wish?   No, no! A thousand times no!   Because when I see you talking to Gandhi, I feel like totally not kissing you.   You wanna kiss something, Cleo?   You can start with my solid gold ass!   Up high, Lincoln Continental!   Dude, don't leave me hanging.   C'mon Abe, it's me.   Gandhi.   Don't you know me?   Sorry, Gandhi.   I'm kinda tired.   Fine.   I never thought the world would see Abraham Lincoln dissing Mahatma Gandhi.   Gandhi, no!   Not our matching friendship locket!   Best dudes forever, Abe?   Best dudes forever?   I brought you some fries.   I was thinking you could, I dunno, stick some in your nose.   Like old times.   Keep yer damn fries.   Look Gandhi, when I chose not to high five you yesterday,   it wasn't because I don't care about you.   It was because I didn't wanna touch you.   I'm sorry, is somebody talking?   'Cause I don't see anyone.   Gandhi--   Hi Cleo.   Yeah, I got your fax.   Yeah, I already called ahead to the lipblam shelter.   Yeah. I'm going right now.   I'm going right now.   Once we were warriors    Running with the streets.    Got to remember the fire,    Don't give in to the heat.    Remember the memories.    Life is only a game    You're only a man, now,    Remember your heart,    Remember the flame.    Living and dying,    Dreaming and crying,    Seizing the day,    Carping the diem!    Remember the memories.    Two stars, worlds apart.    Remember the memories.     Hi there, friend.   - Wow, Tom Green! - Who?   You work here?   Oh, I always make time to teach kids the facts about ADD.   And/or ADHD, its hyperactive cousin.   Hey, you're reading my book.   Touch the book.   Liiick the book.   Lick the book. Lick the book. Lick the book.   Book book book book book book book book   Yeah, I haven't read it either.   People with ADD, they aren't good readers.   Wanna go shave a dog?   My friend has ADD,   and everyone in school treats him like kinda leper!   Well that's discrimination!   Hey, do you wanna go take a dump on my parent's bed?   I'm a albatross!   I'm an albatross!   I'm flap flap flapping my albatross wings,    flap flap flapping my albatross wings    Go ahead. I'm here for you.   I er uh,   recently broke up with my er,   girlfriend Cleo.   Remember, too much emotion makes Doctor Scudworth uncomfortable.   But she was the first girl that gave me er,   what's that word?   Feelings!   Is that water leaking out of your face?   What is this touchy-feely bullcrap?   I don't want the power of this sweater no more!   God won't stop talking to me.   His power is the in the mix! I haven't slept in 78 hours.   Oh, my goodness, I'm knackered.   Jeez, that guy's like 45!   Whee! It's experimental surgery time!   Go on man, do it. I want you to.   Stick it in my head, I hope it kills me.   You're not terrified, where's the sport?   I don't wanna live in a world where buds diss their homeboys.   You're a high school principal, you don't know what's like to be lonely!   On the contrary, Gandhi. Some principals do feel loneliness.   We're not the invincible gods that teen magazines would have you believe.   Then I guess there's no hope for guys like us.   There's always hope, Gandhi.   When life gives you lemons, you clone those lemons   and make super lemons.   So go down to that Awareness Fair,   stand up for what's right,and bring me back a funnel cake!   But there's no way out of this place.   Isn't there?   I think I know what you're saying.   You really helped that boy.   I did.   And without the sweater vest!   I guess it wasn't magic after all!   Or was it?   Is there a Heather in the crowd? Heather?   Heather, I have a message for you.   Jerome wants you to forgive him for hooking up with LupÃ© at Trey's party.   And God is commanding all of us to give a shout out,   to all the locos at the In-N-Out at La Puente!   His power is in the mix!   We're 107FM, with a mix of fresh Christian jams, slam first!   His power is in the mix.   Coming up, we've got a rock crusade!   Forty minutes of non-stop Amy Grant!   Okay, okay.   I, you know, I gotta take a okay.   I can't believe it, ay.   Jermone hooked up with LupÃ©?   What the hell are you doing here?   You're selling kisses, I'm buying.   Abe, will you form a mob, and get rid of this loser?   No.   But I will INform a mob, with the help of this winner.   - Tom? - Hi everybody.   I'm Ottawa's Tom Green,   I live in Hollywood.   Thank you.   So some of you may have been mean to a kid with ADD.   That's not cool.   Coffee?   Anyone for coffee, anyone?   Sorry.   I like cotton candy.   Check out my muscle. Potato chips. It's a ferris wheel!   So I guess what I'm trying to say is,   plastic bag, plastic bag, plastic bag, plastic bag,   Like Mr Green so eloquently said,   ADD is not infectious.   What is infectious is ignorance.   If everyone keeps treating Gandhi like a contagious freak,   then this isn't an awareness fair.   It's an awareness unfair.   - You think I was born yesterday? - Who likes cheese?   Aaabe? You know what you have to do.   You're right.   I'm an ordinary guy    in an ordinary world    sing an ordinary song    Dude! That was not cool!   Not cool!   And 'cause of that, I am only paying you, four dollars.   My discomfort with a man kissing another man   is stronger than my hatred for people with ADD!   Hey, let's all accept Gandhi and shun Abe instead!   Wow, Abe.   Your brave, homoerotic gesture has changed my view about ADD.   Just don't touch me.   Gandhi? Get on up here and dance!   But I didn't bring my dance skins.   - Gandhi! - Okay,   you got me!   Maybe I can help.   I think God left one last song in me.   Ya'll ready for God?   Next time, on a very special Clone High.   Will Abe and Joan's student films reveal their true feelings for one another?   How will Scudworth get himself out of another dangerous pickle?   And what will become of Gandhi?   I'd tell you, but I haven't seen the episode yet.   They were supposed to send it to me,   but there's this guy at work who totally hates me.   If he gets me fired, I'm gonna kill his dog.
1  Previously, on a very special Clone High.   Joan made a declaration.   Abe, I want you.   And Abe found a new form of recreation.   He's not gay or anything.   Abe actually likes Cleo. A girl.   That was just a hilarious plot twist.   Hey, you miss an episode, it's your funeral.   I'm talking to you, Doug.   Way way back in the 1980s'    Secret government employees    Dug up famous guys and ladies    And made amusing genetic copies    Now the clones are sexy teens, now    They're gonna make it if they try    Loving learning challenge judging    Time to laugh and shiver and Cry    Clone High, Clone High    I've never seen so few fans at a cross country meet.   Lope, Abe Lincoln, lope!   Man, it's hot.   I think I'll pour this sports drink all over myself.   Ooh, it's sticky.   Dinger!   I won! And I didn't even scuff my loafers!   Oh my god! We just won a cross country duel meet!   Let's destroy property to show how much we appreciate the team!   Stupid stop sign!   Yeah! Books!   Ready? Okay!   Riot!   Yeah! Books!   Flip the pool!   Thank you!   Those loveable scamps!   They're rioting at a college level!   Riot!   Now let's talk about yesterday's horrifying shenanigans.   Feel free to say anything,   because today I'm gonna be your care-iff.   You see.   Okay, moving on   I know teenagers have an awful lot of confusing feelings,   but today it is unlawful, to bottle 'em up.   You gotta LET EM OUT!   Like I do, every night between ten and ten-fifteen   on a pillow shaped like my father.   So let's brainstorm some constructive ways we can express ourselves.   Uh, Joan of Arc makes movies.   Uh, I make films? Kay? On video?   Experimental video art,   particularly not intended for audiences.   Okay, wonderful!   Making films is a, is a,   is a relatively inexpensive way to express oneself, I guess.   I'd like to help.   I was on that cross country team!   For this reason, I hereby volunteer to organise the first annual   Take Back The Afternoon Film Festival To Save Clone High!   Fantastic! Now we'll never have another riot!   Listen, we've all done things we're not proud of after a good cross country meet.   But that riot was unacceptable.   Unacceptable? Did you see the pool?   They FLIPPED the bitch!   Principal Scudworth, if you were running this school properly there would be no riots.   Only clone soldiers trained for superior intellectual and physical combat.   Little do they know,   I have my own plans for these clones.   Plans that don't involve these shadowy figures at all.   You're talking in a normal indoor speaking voice.   So I am.   Little do they know, I have my own plans for these--   Scudworth! You're walking on thin ice, man.   Clone of Karen Carpenter thin.   I think this is an issue we should talk about.   In person.   Maybe we could have dinner!   Perhaps the Olive Garden.   It's like eating in the private kitchen of a delightful Italian stereotype!   We were thinking somewhere more intimate.   Your house. Next Friday. No dairy.   Please.   Dammit!   I haven't been to the Olive Garden in like, forever!   Mr Butlertron, my bosses are coming over for dinner,   and look at this place!   I haven't changed a thing since I got my degree in the mad sciences from ASU!   Maybe some overpriced knickknacks will add a touch of class.   They've got a great selection down at Restoration Pottery Peer N Barrel.   Are you thinking what I'm programmed to be thinking?   Shopping spree!   Shakka branna, George Washington Carver!   dammit, Gandhi!   You know how I hate to be interrupted while I'm in my peanut lab!   Okay, check this out.   I have this ass-kicking idea for the film fest.   It's about these two cops, and they're different,   but in many ways, they're the same.   It's staring me, and check this out, it's staring you!   No.   See, it's two different cops, from two different precincts,   learning to fight crime together as buddies!   Please go away.   Check this out!   You play Leon Black, and I'm   Tandoori Jones!   And you won't believe what it's called.   - Black and Tan? - Black and Tan!   High five, racial pride!   I don't like those movies, Mahatma.   They're filled with bad dialogue and trite plot twists,   and they perpetuate racial stereotypes.   Naw, dog. See, this is about dissing racial stereotypes.   The know the old one about how Indians and Blacks don't get along?   No.   Well Black and Tan will prove, that even though we're different,   we're ultimately a hilarious combo!   Good day, Gandhi. Good day!   There's a part for the peanut.   We're listening   Next!   Thank God I got the key to this editing room.   Aw yeah. Casting couch.   Wow! Clipart!   You know, I'm glad we get to spend some time alone.   Hi, Abe. My film is really coming along.   I'm doing an autobiography called   The Best Of The Best Of The Best Of The Best the Best.   The whole premise is how tough it is to be me.   Popular, smart, well travelled, and incredibly well-endowed.   Boob-wise.   Hey, is there a time limit on the films?   Would you tell a sunset that it couldn't last forever?   Sunsets last six minutes.   Does a sunset have a soundtrack featuring Smash Mouth?   See ya.   And Abe? I'll see you, at the movies.   Joooooaaaan!   Joan! Thank God you're okay!   I've been looking all over the restaurant for you!   Abe, we put out an APB on your missing friend.   It's okay, officer, I found her.   What are you doing here?   It's not safe, this table's not even bussed!   I don't know how to say this.   You don't have to.   You think the film fest is too commercial.   - I do? - Yes.   Film at Clone High used to be just you and Andy Warhol and your disturbing art films.   But now Cleo's got her epic, Gandhi's doing his cop movie,   and Mother Teresa's got that teen slasher sex romp.   But it's not about them.   This festival's all about you. Joan.   Me? Abe?   You, and me, and what you have here.   Heart-wise. Like my film.   It's everything I've been wadding up the sad chamber of my heart!   And now I'm shooting that wad.   In thirty-five millimetre.   Joan, isn't there just one thing in that beautiful and honest heart of yours   that you need to express?   Yes Abe. I love--   Shh. Don't tell me.   how me.   In your film.   Well, I'll see you guys.   Okay now, Cleo baby.   This is the shot where you reveal how difficult your life really is.   And, go!   Oh, I'm sorry, Ang.   Am I having a nightmare?   Because if I was awake, those cue cards would be written in CALLIGRAPHY!   Oh my God, I am so sorry.   Get the hell out of here! You are not my son!   Okay, remember. You're Gabe.   Gabe Linkoln.   Now your motivation is that you're in love with your best friend,   but you just haven't told her yet, and go!   Line?   There is no line right now, you just scream and weep.   And go!   At first, I thought you were wack, Black.   But now, we've both learned that when east meets west, it's deadly!   Bueno momento, Black and Tan.   Eat shell!   Go to hell, SeÃ±or Peanie!   Last one there's a rotten huevo!   Say what?   Cut. No no no, man.   You're making me fall asleep!   To death, bro.   Okay, the line is, "say whaaaaaat?"   Say what?   - Say whaaaaaat? - Say what?   - Saaaaay, - Say.   - Whaaaaaaaaaat? - What?   Say whaa--   Gandhi! This character is not me.   - Say whaaa-- - Stop it! Listen!   You and I, don't get along!   I'm off the project!   Watch out for that water tower!   Wow, G-Dub. You saved my life!   Hey man, would you stay if I rewrote your character?   No! I'll rewrite it. My way.   Say whaaaaaaaaat?   Remember, this film is my heart.   I want your voice to weep with honesty and truth!   And all that is real in this world. Aaaand go!   And all that is real in this world. Aaaand go!   There's nothing in the rule book that says a giraffe can't play football.   No. Feel it!   There's nothing in the rule book that says a giraffe can't play football.   Get out your funbrella, Mr B!   Because it's raining style!   ç¼ºæ­è¯    Well, there it is. I'm finished!   Well I'm not. Keep it down over there!   Finally, a film that perfectly expresses all of my feelings for Abe.   Hey, Joan. What was that you were saying quietly?   Abe! Hi, I just finished my film, and it really expresses my true--   I'm so proud of you.   Opening yourself up, and expressing what's inside.   You're such an honest and true friend.   Friend?   It's been hard for me because I'm trying to win over Cleo,   and run the film fest,   but knowing I have you as a pal, gives me the strength to do it.   Pal?   Don't worry, bro.   Cleo will never take your place as my best friend.   Bro?   Yeah, even closer than a sister.   So close that we could sleep in the same bed and never touch or kiss.   So anyway, thanks for expressing yourself, man.   Man.   Joan, I almost forgot to pick up your--   Amigo? Buddy? Fella? Where are you, guy?   Hey, what's this?   You're going to express yourself, Joan.   Even if I have to do it for you.   Do you mind?   Some of us are nailing Catherine the Great here!   Or should I say, Catherine the So-So?   Abe? Abe? Abe, why is my name on the program?   Because it deserves to be.   I found your film in the trash can and I submitted it.   No! No, you don't understand, Abe!   This film is embarrassing! For both of us!   How could I be embarrassed by a friend?   Who's got the legs? Me! That's who! Me!   Who knows, Joan?   Maybe your film will change the world.   That's what I'm afraid of.   Open up, Thomas Edison.   I know what you're after, Joan.   And you're not gonna get it!   But you don't understand!   Or do I?   - No! - Or is it yes?   No! Let me in!   You can try all you want, Joan.   But we both know that even an angry woman   can't claw through steel that's two feet thick!   Well, the apartment's all finished!   I couldn't've done it without you, Mr B!   And speaking of without you, go hide in the kitchen.   But, Wesley   My entire career is riding on the success of this dinner.   And I don't need the electronic help muddling it up!   Don't let him see you cry.   Just make it to the kitchen.   Meet Leon Black, a Harvard educated scientist   turned expert police detective.   Meet Tandoori Jones, a jive talking, smooth walking typical Indian supercop,   who ç¼ºå¨è¯ by his own rules   None!   Together they are   Black and Tan!   Thus concludes this caper.   And speaking of capers, I thought we ordered from a deli!   Oh, it's from a deli all right.   New Delhi, India.   We've been transferred there for our next adventure!   What is that you saaaaaay?   Now I'd like to introduce my film It Takes A Hero.   Here is my soul, friends. My soul.   I love you.   He's going, home.   I have your baby in me, giraffe!   Wow. Single tear.   Okay.   Our next film, by Cleopatra, is titled The Best Of The Best of the--   Oh my god!   Damn coal powered projectors!   Well, all the films are ruined.   There is no God!   There is a God!   Except Joan's film, which has somehow expanded in the fire,   and will now be seen in widescreen.   Ugh, there is no God.   This is a sign, Joan!   If you don't express yourself, you'll just keep saying "fine"   when someone asks you how you are.   And then one day someone will say "How are you, Joan?"   And you know what your answer will be?   There won't be one. Because you'll be dead.   So, religion's for fools, eh?   Fools and liberals!   Hello. Am I in space?   Because you all look out of this wooorld.   Board of Shadowy Figures,   I'd like to you meet Mr Butlertron.   My butl--   no. My friend.   Well Scudworth I must confess,   We actually came to dinner tonight to kill you.   But we had such a wonderful time   that we're going to give you another chance!   Oh Mr B. You've done it again!   Look. I think it's obvious what this is about,   so let's just get it over with.   Whisper, whisper.   Hush, hush.   Celine Dion-athon, Celine Dion-athon.   Whisper, whiiiisper. Whisper!   Ha-ha ha-ha ha-ha, you love A-abe!   Go away, Sigmund Freud.   Could it be any more obvious?   Well that's it! Wasn't this the best film fest ever?!   Yeah!   I can't hear you, Clone High!   Film fest! Film Fest!   So, I guess things are totally different now.   Not really, everyone's still rioting.   No, I mean with my film.   Now you know the truth about how I feel.   Uh yeah.   And it doesn't change things?   Uh No?   Thanks for not making this too weird.   I just felt so exposed,   because mine was the only film that was truely personal.   What? Did you watch my movie Joan,   or did you just see it?   Unlike you, I didn't make a beeline for the obvious.   I used a little something called symbolism.   You see Joan, I was that giraffe.   Wow. So, if you were the giraffe, who was that little girl?   Good night, Joan. Good night.   I've got nothing to say   Next time, on a very special Clone High.   JFK and Cleo break up for reals.   Joan and Cleo duke it out, lady style.   And something tragic may or may not happen.
1  Previously on a very special Clone High:   Joan got a new roommate.   Abe and Cleo continued to date.   And Gandhi became an inmate.   Here's a paper plate.   Way way back in the 1980s'    Secret government employees    Dug up famous guys and ladies    And made amusing genetic copies    Now the clones are sexy teens, now    They're gonna make it if they try    Loving learning challenge judging    Time to laugh and shiver and Cry    Clone High, Clone High    Dear family and friends,   is it possible a year has passed   since my last impersonal, informative, photocopied holiday update.   I can hardly believe it's only been a year,   since the United Nations abolished religious holidays   in favour of the all-inclusive, non-offensive, Snowflake Day.   Well this blows.   Oh my god, Snowflake Day is almost here!   Snowflake Jake, this holiday's mascot,   will come to my house and bring me spices upon spices!   Oh, joyous day.   What do you have against Snowflake Day, anyway?   It's not like all of those exclusive religious holidays   like Christmas, Chanukah, Kwanzaa   Ooh, it's time for the ceremonial lighting of the snowman!   Jolly Snowflake Day, Joan.   Would you like a bite of my lamb taco?   It's just not Snowflake Day without a lamb taco.   Cripes! Why is everyone so cripes darn cheerful?   Well, you better be cheerful at my annual Snowflake Day party,   because those crackers won't hand out themselves.   I can't wait.   Neither can I, Joan!   We're all going to exchange Snowflake Day care satchels!   Speaking of which, Abe,   I can't wait for my big, expensive Snowflake Day gift.   Oh, don't worry, Cleo! I'll get you the best gift ever!   A clamp to keep her legs closed?   No, even better than that!   Where am I gonna get money to buy Cleo a good present?   Have a Bar Mitzvah dude, you get made stacks!   Sounds sweet, but I think I'm gonna do the Christian thing:   Get a job.   Right on.   Both Bill Gates and Will Smith have jobs,   and they're millionaires!   To jobs!   It's the most lucrative tiiime of the yeeeaar!    Voice of an angel, baby.   - An angel! - Gay dads, enough fawning!   We gotta get my annual Snowflake Day album done!   Deck the deck with gay apparel, fala lala lala    Gay apparel   like the pants you know?   Dude, this blows.   I don't know how Bill Gates and Will Smith do this.   Come on, Gandhi!   Two more hours, and we'll've paid for the mall parking!   I need a fork!   Always with the utensils!   And mayhaps a knife as well?   Every time! I have to make two trips!   "Can I have a fork?" "Can I have a knife?"   Jeez! Every time.   Lincoln, we need those plates right now!   Gandhi, traditional Snowflake Sombrero dance, pronto!   What a jerk!   Napoleon's got some sort of a complex.   I don't know what it is, but man!   Groin fire!   We eat our mistakes here, Monsieur Abe!   But I dropped a glass!   Eat it! EAT IT! (Speaks French)   Whaat?   Abe, if I said we could be millionaires,   would you quit with me right now?   I'll give it some serious consideration.   Now, jump on me back,   and whisper yer wish for spices in me ear.   If you don't fill my rack with cumin this year,   I swear to God I'll get you fired!   Yo ho ho. You'll get yer wish, ya booger.   Get off me back, or I'll murder yer grandparents.   Why do I take this job every year?   Now, go empty me chum bucket.   It's starting to smell like a day old hooker.   I hate you, you nasty, crap eating monkey!   Arr.   I'll tell you what spice she's got! Sassafras!   I hate this stupid holiday!   Don't say that, Joan.   And, I could've used that chum.   Sorry, I didn't realise you--   How'd you know my name?   I don't know your name. I call everyone Joan.   It's like saying dude, or bro, or in your case, Joan of Arc.   But, that's not important right now.   What is important is that   you continue to spread the Snowflake Day spirit.   Snowflake Day sucks!   All those kids are so greedy!   "Oh give me some spices!" "I'm fat!" "I want some parsley!"   Lucky kids with their spices.   I have to eat the salt they sprinkle on the roads when the ice freezes.   Who cares about spices and seasonings and traditional snowflake meats?   Snowflake Day is just another made up holiday,   courtesy of the greeting card industry,   just like Valentine's Day and Easter.   I can take her out right now.   You know for many, this season is about giving.   So um, can I have fifty cents so I can eat today?   Ugh! See? Even you, a homeless person, greedy and selfish!   Well, if it's spices everybody wants,   I'll pepper their precious Snowflake Day,   with a little slice of sabotage pie.   Joan of Arc style!   Hey, are you Mandy Moore?   Me? No.   This mic? Doesn't even work.   So You're just an incredibly hot homeless person?   You'd be surprised at how many ab machines you find in dumpsters.   Plus I have a trainer.   In addition to my crippling bunions of last year,   I have also been diagnosed with corns.   But in this happy season, we all have to be thankful.   Thankful that the plantar warts in my other foot,   have been removed.   Save one. I call him Gary,   and he's part of the family now!   He'd better buy me a good present!   It's perfect! It's half knife, half fork. Like the spork.   Vincent Spork took home a Nobel for that baby!   Mm-hm. And now people don't have to hold a fork and a knife to cut,   then switch hands to eat their sweet meat.   They can just use one brilliant tool.   Like you, Gandhi. A brilliant tool.   Exactly!   Hey, why're you bleeding, dawg?   Well, the knife portion seems to have sliced open my cheek.   How about a sliding plastic sheath   to cover up the blade when the fork portion is in use?   Okay, we're just gonna need a system of ball bearings   to make the sheath slide!   But it'll need to be counterstabilised.   I'm thinkin'   Trigger assembly! Jinx!   Should we have a strap to hold down the meat when we cut it, or Velcro?   Oh, Velcro. Definitely.   And there's only one solution for the oscillating serrated edge.   Coal power! Get out of my head!   You get out of my head!   I gotta hand it to you,   the foot pedal and the popsicle sticks really worked!   We're gonna be rich, Gandhi!   I'm gonna be able to buy Cleo the best gift ever!   Now, as far as the name, I was thinking Knifork.   - Bladeforker! - Utensil!   - Sir Slicenspere! - Fike!   Knork! Oh my God!   - Fantastic! - Awesome!   Come on man, we rehearsed this.   Sorry.   We now return to Snowflake Jake Saves Snowflake Day.   Arr. Any last words, Santy Claus,   Dreidelstein and King Kwanzaa?   It be time for you, and your exclusionary holidays, to walk to the plank.   Jake! Don't kill us!   We've realised that the harmless celebration of our religions is oppressive!   Dreidelstein sorry. Gimel.   Your way is right, and our way is wrong.   Oh, not wrong. Just specific.   And specificity be the enemy of unity.   Now, let us all join in a traditional   All Religions Are Equally Valid Traditional Snowflake Day Celebratory Cabbage Patch.   Ugh! I can't believe you guys watch that Snowflake Day crap!   I may be blind,   but I can still see you're losing your Snowflake Day spirit, girl.   You know Snowflake Jake might not shoot us   by his cannonball at our party if youcontinue to act so ill mannered!   Who cares? I'm not going to the stupid party anyway!   But my presence, will be felt.   Oh yes, oh yes, my presence, will be felt.   But you have to come to my party!   You're serving the crackers!   Where else am I gonna get a cracker girl at this late hour?   Um Fourth and Maple?   Oh relax, this music sure is putting me in the mood.   Oh course it is. It's JFK Sings The Er, Uh, Snowflake Day Hits!   Away in a taco, no spice for my lamb    Snowflake Snowflake Snowflake, I made you out of snow.    Jerky balls, jerky balls, jerky beef jer-ky.    Jerky balls, tasty balls,    balls of meat, jerk so sweet.    It's a Jeff Foxworthy Redneck Snowflake Daaay!    More brandy, dear?   No thanks. I'm pregnant!   Get your album here!   See dude, that's called marketing.   Marketing brings the coin.   Marketing, ehhh?   Ladies and gentlemen!   Witness the miracle utensil,   that's sweeping the exotic nation, of Europe.   You, ma'am! Why are you all deformed?   Oh, it's the saddest story, medical expert.   I have this hideous deformity   from hunching over a plate using two utensils,   for lo these many years.   A knife and fork.   - Ma'am, have you ever tried a knork? - A hwhaaat?   - Knork knork. - Who's there?   A knork. Half knife, half fork.   That would cut my silverware budget in half!   No to mention the toughest beef briscuit!   I can walk again!   I say, let us all purchase this miracle!   I agree with the dandy.   Hmm Great device. That's quite a unit!   Why, even a child can use it.   Come here, giant boy!   Just pump the gas valve with your foot there,   pull out the choke,   and like magic, the knork begins to--   Oh, I think it's in an artery,   oh oh, oh God it's inside me now!   Joany, are you putting itching powder into the eye patches?   I may be blind,   but I can still tell when somebody's trying to sabotage Snowflake Day.   I hate Snowflake Day!   Congratulations, Joan.   You just got yourself a one way ticket to Snowflake Jake's ill-mannered list!   Remember when you were a kid?   And you used to do your traditional Cabbage Patching?   Cabbage Patch with us, Joan. Come on!   No! I hate this family! I'm running away and never coming back!   That's the spirit, Joany.   You sure can Cabbage Patch.   That's right.   She's lost her Snowflake Day spirit.   Sure as shootin' she's lost it.   And after fifty-two hours, I finally passed the stone.   And in the end, isn't that what Snowflake Day, is really about?   Hello, Joan.   Oh, it's you. That sexy dumpster teen.   I know that you're running away from home   after sabotaging Cleo's party.   It's just that I hate her, and she's dating the boy I love,   and I have to live with her because me and Toots' house burned down,   and I hate her!   Wait. How'd you know that?   I can see it in your heart.   Joan, your family misses you.   They're worried about you.   Joany! Joany! Come back home, girl.   I knew you'd come back!   That's a good Joany.   It's alright, I'm just happy you're home.   Now follow me.   I'll show you something about Snowflake Day   And yourself.   I don't know.   Toots told me I shouldn't let homeless people show me things.   Come with me. And I'll forever change your life.   Forever.   - Are you sure you're not Mandy Moo-- - No.   Seriously? Because you really--   Get off of my back, okay?   Leave me alone, I already said no, are you stupid or something?   You ruined my life, knork!   Who would've thought a get rich quick scheme wouldn't work?   I told you we should've made a spife!   So you're out twenty thousand dollars.   Just make Cleo something from your heart.   The ocean has nothing on your deep blue eyes    And the sunshine is jealous of your smile.    so how could I ignore    all the feelings I have for  - Dinger!   I just hard to find a way to let you know  - Art, you've done it again.   You took me to this dump to show me the Snowflake Day spirit?   This is no dump. It's your old house.   The one that burnt down.   Welcome home, Joan. Welcome home.   I didn't know poor people could have fun!   They have the Snowflake Day spirit, Joan.   These people don't need spices or silks or a balanced diet   to have the joy of the season.   They just need each other.   So you find the Snowflake Day spirit   when you hang out with the homeless?   Yes and no.   More like you find it when you hang out with your friends.   Be they homeless, or homed.   My goodness, it's true!   I've abandoned my family and friends,   I've slashed their tyres and urinated in their punch   I realise now, I've lost the Snowflake Day spirit!   Sure as shootin', I've lost it!   Someone has slipped laxatives into these lamb tacos!   Oh my god, you guys, someone put goat's blood on the doorjamb.   Bad Joany! Bad bad bad, Joany!   First you sabotage the party,   now you're chewing through my Achilles tendon!   And you know my Achilles tendon is my one Achilles' heal!   Everyone, it is now time for the traditional   Snowflake care satchel exchange!   Cleo, we've been together for a long time.   Almost four weeks.   And that's why I wanted to give you this.   It's a love coupon book!   One free snuggle, one backrub,   see that's your silhouette in macaroni!   And those pipe cleaners are--   I'm confused.   Why didn't you just buy me something expensive?   But I stayed up all night making this.   Well you should've stayed up all night   buying me an expensive present.   Now I'm not sure if you deserve this, but here.   A knork?   A KNORK?!   I got it at the Sharper Image.   LIIIEEES! You just pulled this out of the garbage!   This junk gift had absolutely no thought or meaning!   Well, you didn't say what you wanted!   I clearly stated that I wanted something that was   A, expensive,   B, bought,   and C, not lovingly hand crafted!   I see.   I guess you're not the person I thought you were.   I'm going to get some bite sized wieners now.   Bite sized wieners!   Who put razor blades in these?   Why does my mouth keep getting cut up?!   Whhhhy?!   Homeless!   I'm back, family and friends!   Joany! I thought you were dead!   I shot you for biting me so much.   Oh Toots.   Everyone, I've got something really important to say.   Don't drink the punch!   These derelicts taught me something today.   Snowflake Day is not about greediness, or ruining parties.   It's about being with friends, and family.   And realising what you're got.   - So that's what this is all about. - This punch is amazing!   You know what, Abe?   It doesn't matter that you got me a crappy present.   I'm happy to have you, as a backup gift.   And I'll give you your backup present later.   You mean?   That's right. I'm gonna show you my left boob.   Oh Pancho, finally we will meet.   Now, new friends and old,   let us unite, and celebrate Snowflake Day!   Everyone! Cabbage Patch!   Hark!   Snowflake Jake is nigh!   I can hear his cannonballs a-comin'!   He is real! He is real!   Step away from the target, or you'll get hit.   Everyone into the basement!   Hurry it up now, in you go.   To the basement!   Can you believe it? Snowflake Jake?   I wished for curry!   Look, everyone. It's snowing outside.   Where'd that hot homeless chick   who may or may not've been Mandy Moore go?   - I don't know. - Maybe she had a gig.   She just disappeared.   So she wasn't Mandy Moore.   She was an angel! An angel all along.   Well jolly Snowflake Day, angel!   Jolly Snowflake Day everyone!   Jolly Snowflake Day everyone!   Next week, on a very special Clone High.   Joan gets a makeover.   Gandhi gets a makeover.   Principal Scudworth gets a makeover?   And old Abe stays the same.   loveable.   Maybe I'll get a wax or something.
